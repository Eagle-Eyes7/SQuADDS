However, degradation in qubit coherence time and readout fidelity has been observed even under moderate drive amplitudes corresponding to a few photons populating the measurement resonator. Here, we numerically explore the dynamics of a driven transmon-resonator system under strong and nearly resonant measurement drives and find clear signatures of transmon ionization where the qubit escapes out of its cosine potential. Using a semiclassical model, we interpret this ionization as resulting from resonances occurring at specific resonator-photon populations. We find that the photon populations at which these spurious transitions occur are strongly parameter dependent and that they can occur at low resonator-photon population, something that may explain the experimentally observed degradation in measurement fidelity.},

Our device is based on a tunable coupler that can be made lossy when tuned into resonance with a broadband filter mode. When driven parametrically, this coupler induces loss on any mode coupled to it with energy detuning equal to the drive frequency. We demonstrate the use of this device to reset a superconducting qubit's readout cavity after a measurement, resetting it with a characteristic time of under 20 ns. We also demonstrate that the dissipation can be driven constantly and thus suppress thermal photon fluctuations in the cavity, effectively eliminating thermal photon fluctuations as a relevant decoherence channel. Our results demonstrate the utility of our device as a modular tool for environmental engineering and entropy removal in circuit QED.},

  abstract = {Extracting the Hamiltonian of interacting quantum-information processing systems is a keystone problem in the realization of complex phenomena and large-scale quantum computers. The remarkable growth of the field increasingly requires precise, widely-applicable, and modular methods that can model the quantum electrodynamics of the physical circuits, and even of their more-subtle renormalization effects. Here, we present a computationally-efficient method satisfying these criteria. The method partitions a quantum device into compact lumped or quasi-distributed cells. Each is first simulated individually. The composite system is then reduced and mapped to a set of simple subsystem building blocks and their pairwise interactions. The method operates within the quasi-lumped approximation and, with no further approximation, systematically accounts for constraints, couplings, parameter renormalizations, and non-perturbative loading effects. We experimentally validate the method on large-scale, state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors. We find that the full method improves the experimental agreement by a factor of two over taking standard coupling approximations when tested on the most sensitive and dressed Hamiltonian parameters of the measured devices.},

  abstract = {Superconducting quantum processors have a long road ahead to reach fault-tolerant quantum computing. One of the most daunting challenges is taming the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art technologies, including the world's largest quantum processors, employ aluminum oxide (AlO\$\_x\$) tunnel Josephson junctions (JJs) as sources of nonlinearity, assuming an idealized pure \${\textbackslash}sin{\textbackslash}varphi\$ current-phase relation (C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R). However, this celebrated \${\textbackslash}sin{\textbackslash}varphi\$ C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R is only expected to occur in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlO\$\_x\$ barrier. Here we show that the standard C\${\textbackslash}varphi\$R fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunneling through an inhomogeneous AlO\$\_x\$ barrier predicts \%-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The reality of Josephson harmonics transforms qubit design and prompts a reevaluation of models for quantum gates and readout, parametric amplification and mixing, Floquet qubits, protected Josephson qubits, etc. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and the associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude, while preserving anharmonicity.},

The challenge of designing a circuit is to compromise between realizing a set of performance metrics and reducing circuit complexity and noise sensitivity. At the same time, one needs to explore a large design space, and computational approaches often yield long simulation times. Here, we automate the circuit design task using SCILLA. The software SCILLA performs a parallelized, closed-loop optimization to design superconducting circuit diagrams that match predefined properties, such as spectral features and noise sensitivities. We employ it to design 4-local couplers for superconducting flux qubits and identify a circuit that outperforms an existing proposal with a similar circuit structure in terms of coupling strength and noise resilience for experimentally accessible parameters.
