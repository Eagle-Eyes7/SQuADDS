# SQuADDS Database Project

## Overview
The SQuADDS (Superconducting Qubit And Device Design and Simulation) Database Project is an open-source resource aimed at advancing research in superconducting quantum device designs. It provides a robust workflow for generating and simulating superconducting quantum device designs, facilitating the accurate prediction of Hamiltonian parameters across a wide range of design geometries.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Interpolation**: Utilizes a comprehensive database for interpolating Hamiltonian parameters, ensuring high precision in predictions.
- **User-Specified Target Parameters**: Allows users to define target parameters such as qubit anharmonicity, coupling strength, resonator linewidth, and frequency.
- **Experimental Validation**: Includes experimentally measured data for enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the simulations.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Encourages contributions from the community, expanding the database and refining the simulation models.

## Usage
1. **Connect to the SQuADDS Database**: Initiate a connection to access a wide range of pre-simulated designs.
2. **Select Circuit QED Elements**: Choose specific quantum electrodynamics elements such as transmon cross, coplanar waveguide (CPW), and CLT coupler.
3. **Input Target Hamiltonian Parameters**: Define parameters like qubit frequency (f_q), anharmonicity (α), resonator frequency (f_r), and linewidth (κ).
4. **Receive and Utilize Output**: The database provides the closest pre-simulated design along with Hamiltonian parameters and an interpolated design with simulation hyperparameters.
